For sake of simplicity, some files need to be regenerated when the original iso change. Here is a list of changes:
 - toadd/linux/images/efiboot.img
	* Change grub.conf to include rd.live.ram and ks=...

The iwe.img is a compressed squasfs that is generated with:
	cd /tmp
	mkdir iwe
	sudo dnf --installroot=/tmp/iwe --releasever=27 install facter rubygem-json
	Then copy iwe client to the propper location
	And generate the squashfs with
	mksquashfs /tmp/iwe ~/dev/iwe/installer/toadd/linux/images/iwe.img -comp xz
